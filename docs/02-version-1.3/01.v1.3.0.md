## üéâ Major Changes

### 1. Enhanced Client Architecture
- Improved client structure with clearer responsibilities and scope
- Each class now has a well-defined set of functions
- Standardized initialization and cleanup processes

- Replaced dictionary-based data structures with strongly-typed models

### 2. Web Interface Migration
- Completely rewritten [web interface](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/agentsociety/tree/v1.3.0/agentsociety/webapi) in Python
- Released as **open-source** with stable version
- Improved user experience and interface design

### 3. Environment Dependencies
- Migrated from MQTT to Redis for message handling
- Added service-specific naming in [docker-compose file](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/agentsociety/tree/v1.3.0/docker/docker-compose.yml) to prevent naming conflicts
- Improved service identification and management

### 4. Configuration System
- Unified configuration system for both backend and frontend
- Streamlined configuration management
- Enhanced configuration sharing between components

### 5. Performance Improvements
- Significantly reduced startup time
- Optimized initialization processes
- Improved overall system responsiveness

### 6. Enhanced Agent System
- Expanded agent types to include:
  - [Citizens](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/agentsociety/tree/v1.3.0/agentsociety/agent.py#L21)
  - [Firms](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/agentsociety/tree/v1.3.0/agentsociety/agent.py#L360)
  - [Banks](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/agentsociety/tree/v1.3.0/agentsociety/agent.py#L366)

  - [Government](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/agentsociety/tree/v1.3.0/agentsociety/agent.py#L382)
- Each agent type can be customized through [AgentConfig](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/agentsociety/tree/v1.3.0/agentsociety/configs/agent.py)
- Support for multiple agent instances of the same class
- Removed dependency on CityAgent for agent creation

### 7. Model Deployment
- Added support for private model deployment
- Integrated [VLLM support](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/agentsociety/tree/v1.3.0/agentsociety/llm/llm.py#L53) for any OpenAI-compatible interface

### 8. Technical Requirements
- Minimum Python version requirement **increased** to 3.11
- Updated dependencies and compatibility requirements

### 9. Resource Management
- Added automatic group size and PostgreSQL worker size [calculation](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/agentsociety/tree/v1.3.0/agentsociety/configs/__init__.py#L136), achieving memory optimization to prevent Out of Memory issues
- Enhanced resource allocation and management

### 10. Configuration Validation
- Added new `agentsociety check` command for configuration validation
