# Web UI

Here we provide instructions on how to use our Web UI.

There are two ways to use the Web UI: the first is to use our online platform (available at [https://agentsociety.fiblab.net/](https://agentsociety.fiblab.net/)), and the second is to deploy and launch it locally. The usage methods for both are essentially the same. However, if you choose to use our online platform, you will need to pay for the large model API and server rental fees. This chapter will explain how to use the Web UI and provide detailed instructions on how to deploy the service locally.
